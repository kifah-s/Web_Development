In **Angular**, the **`bootstrap[]`** property in **`@NgModule`** is used to specify the primary component that will be loaded and run when the application starts. This component is considered the "root component" or the main entry point of the application.

### **What is `bootstrap[]` in `@NgModule`?**

- **`bootstrap[]`** is an array that contains the component(s) to be loaded when the application starts.
- Typically, it includes the root component, which is the component that gets rendered inside the **index.html** file.
- When the application initializes, Angular creates an instance of the component listed in **`bootstrap[]`** and renders it on the page.

### **Importance of `bootstrap[]`:**

- **Defines the root component**: It tells Angular which main component should be displayed on the page when the application is launched. Usually, this is the **AppComponent**, which handles the general user interface of the app.

- **Starts the application**: By defining the component in **`bootstrap[]`**, Angular takes care of initializing and running that component, allowing the application to start and function correctly.

### **Example of `bootstrap[]` in `@NgModule`:**

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent], // The root component to be loaded at app startup
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### **When to use `bootstrap[]`:**

- The **`bootstrap[]`** property is used only in the root module to specify the main component Angular should run when the app starts.

### **Difference between `declarations[]` and `bootstrap[]`:**

- **`declarations[]`**: Contains all the components, directives, and pipes that belong to the module.
- **`bootstrap[]`**: Specifies only the main component to be run when the app starts.

### **Summary:**

- **`bootstrap[]`** defines the root component that Angular should load when starting the application.
- It is usually used in the root module **AppModule** and contains **AppComponent** or any other component you want to be the main entry point in the app.

**What is the `bootstrap` property?**

In the context of Angular, the `bootstrap` property within an `NgModule` plays a crucial role in determining the starting point of your application. In simpler terms, it specifies which component will be loaded and rendered first when the application starts. This component, known as the root component, acts as a container for all other components in your application.

**Why do we use the `bootstrap` property?**

- **Starting point:** It defines the component that serves as the entry point to your application.
- **Application structure:** It helps define the overall structure of the application and how components are organized.
- **Initial loading:** It ensures that the root component is loaded and rendered when the application starts.

**Example:**

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    // ... other components
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    // ... other modules
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In the above example:

- `AppComponent` is the root component specified in the `bootstrap` property.
- When the application starts, `AppComponent` will be loaded first and rendered in the HTML page.

**Why is it important to specify the root component?**

- **Structure:** It provides a basic structure for the application, where all other components are attached to the root component.
- **Growth:** It allows you to add new components and manipulate them within the root component.
- **Lazy loading:** The root component can be a starting point for lazily loading other modules when needed.

**Summary**

In essence, the `bootstrap` property in `NgModule` is Angular's mechanism for specifying the component that will be loaded first when the application starts. This component serves as a container for all other components and forms the foundation of your application's structure.

**Important notes:**

- Typically, there is only one root component per application.
- The component specified in `bootstrap` must be declared within the `declarations` of the same module.
- The root component can be as complex or as simple as your application requires.

**Why don't we use `bootstrap` with feature modules?**
Typically, we don't use `bootstrap` with feature modules because they represent specific features within the application and can be lazily loaded when needed. The root component in the main module is responsible for loading these feature modules.
