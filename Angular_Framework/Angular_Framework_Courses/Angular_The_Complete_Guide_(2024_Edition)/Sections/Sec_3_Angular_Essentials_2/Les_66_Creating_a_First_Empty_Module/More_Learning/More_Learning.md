In the **Angular framework**, the **`declarations`** property within **`@NgModule`** is an important part of every module and is used to specify the components, directives, and pipes that belong to that module.

### **What is `declarations` in `@NgModule`?**

The **`declarations`** property is an array that includes all the components, directives, and pipes that should be available within the module. These elements are registered in the module so that they can be used within the templates of other components that belong to the same module.

### **What can be included in `declarations`?**

- **Components**: Angular components that represent reusable parts of the user interface.

- **Directives**: Provide the ability to modify the behavior or appearance of DOM elements in the UI.

- **Pipes**: Used to transform data in templates, such as formatting text or numbers.

### **Importance of `declarations` in Angular:**

1. **Making components, directives, and pipes available within the module:**
   Any component, directive, or pipe defined in `declarations` becomes available for use only inside other components belonging to the same module. For example, if you define a component in module **A**, it cannot be used in module **B** unless you import module **A** into module **B**.

2. **Organizing the application:**  
   `declarations` help organize and define the scope of components and directives that can be used within the module. This makes it easier to manage the application, especially when it contains many components and directives.

### **Example of using `declarations`:**

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { TaskComponent } from "./task/task.component";
import { HighlightDirective } from "./shared/highlight.directive";
import { DatePipe } from "@angular/common";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent, // Main component
    TaskComponent, // Sub component
    HighlightDirective, // Directive
    DatePipe, // Pipe
  ],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### **What cannot be placed in `declarations`?**

- **Services**: Services should not be placed in `declarations`; they are registered in `providers`.

- **Other modules**: If you want to use components, directives, or pipes from another module, you must import that module in the `imports` property, not add it to `declarations`.

### **Summary:**

- **`declarations`** is the property used to specify the components, directives, and pipes of the module.
- `declarations` help organize and use these elements within the module only. If you want to use them outside the module, you need to import the module.

**What is the `declarations` property?**

The `declarations` property in Angular's `NgModule` is essentially a registry or a list of all the elements defined within that specific module. These elements are the building blocks of your Angular user interface and include:

- **Components:** These are the fundamental building blocks of the user interface in Angular. Each component represents a specific part of the UI, like a button, list, or form.
- **Directives:** These are programmatic instructions that allow you to create new UI elements or modify the behavior of existing ones.
- **Pipes:** These are pure functions used to transform data before displaying it in a component template.

**Why do we use the `declarations` property?**

- **Organization:** The `declarations` property helps organize the UI elements specific to a particular module, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Dependency:** It defines the elements that can be used within that module, preventing conflicts between elements defined in different modules.
- **Construction:** It helps build the application's structure by defining the components, directives, and pipes that make up each part of the application.

**Example:**

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, MyComponent, CustomDirective, ShortenPipe],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In the example above:

- `AppComponent` is the main component of the application.
- `MyComponent` is a custom component that has been created.
- `CustomDirective` is a custom directive.
- `ShortenPipe` is a custom pipe for shortening text.

**What happens when you add an element to `declarations`?**

When you add an element to the `declarations` of a module, you're telling Angular that this element belongs to this module and can be used within components that belong to this module or modules that import it.

**Summary**

In short, the `declarations` property in `NgModule` plays a crucial role in organizing and defining the elements that make up the user interface in an Angular application. By understanding this property, you can build more structured and efficient Angular applications.

**Additional notes:**

- The `declarations` property can contain any number of elements.
- The elements must be defined before being added to `declarations`.
- The `declarations` property can be used with feature modules to better organize the application.
