In Angular, **Combining multiple pipes** refers to using more than one pipe in a single chain to apply multiple transformations to the data within a template. Pipes in Angular are used to transform data in a straightforward and convenient way, such as formatting dates, converting text to uppercase/lowercase, or processing numbers.

### How to Combine Multiple Pipes

You can simply use the `|` symbol to chain multiple pipes together. When applying more than one pipe, the output of the first pipe is passed as input to the second pipe, and so on.

### Practical Example

Suppose you have a string and want to:

1. Convert it to uppercase.
2. Then trim it to the first 10 characters.

You can achieve this as follows:

```html
<p>{{ message | uppercase | slice:0:10 }}</p>
```

#### Explanation:

1. **`uppercase`**: Converts the text to uppercase.
2. **`slice:0:10`**: Trims the text from the 0th to the 10th character.

If the value of `message` is `"Angular is awesome"`, the final result will be:  
`ANGULAR I`.

### Another Example: Combining Pipes for Dates and Numbers

Suppose you want to display a date and format it, then apply additional transformations.

```html
<p>{{ currentDate | date:'fullDate' | uppercase }}</p>
```

#### Explanation:

1. **`date:'fullDate'`**: Formats the date into a string like "Tuesday, December 26, 2024".
2. **`uppercase`**: Converts the entire text to uppercase.

If the value of `currentDate` is `new Date()`, the result will display the formatted date in uppercase.

### Key Points:

1. **Chaining depends on the output**: The next pipe must be able to handle the data type output by the previous pipe.
2. **Performance**: Using pipes is simple and efficient, as they are processed directly at the template level.

Before delving into combining pipes, let's understand what pipes are in Angular. Pipes are pure functions that transform data before displaying it in an Angular template. They take an input value, apply transformations to it, and return a new value.

### Why Combine Pipes?

- **Multiple Transformations:** You may need to apply multiple transformations to the same value. Instead of writing complex transformation logic within your template, you can use multiple pipes in a specific order to achieve the desired result.
- **Better Code Readability:** Combining pipes makes your code more readable and maintainable as each transformation becomes clear and separate from the others.

### How to Combine Pipes?

Pipes are combined by placing them side by side in the template, separated by the pipe symbol (|). The pipe on the left is executed first, followed by the pipe on its right, and so on.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a variable named `fullName` containing a person's full name, and we want to display it after converting it to uppercase and removing extra spaces. We can achieve this using the `uppercase` and `trim` pipes as follows:

```html
<p>{{ fullName | uppercase | trim }}</p>
```

In this example:

1. **`uppercase`:** Converts all letters of the name to uppercase.
2. **`trim`:** Removes any extra spaces from the beginning and end of the resulting text.

### Pipe Order

- **Importance of Order:** The order of pipes significantly affects the final result. Pipes should be executed in a logical order to ensure the desired outcome.
- **Illustrative Example:**

```html
{{ ' Hello, World! ' | trim | uppercase }}
```

In this example, extra spaces will first be removed using `trim`, and then the resulting text will be converted to uppercase using `uppercase`.

### Types of Pipes

- **Standard Pipes:** These are pipes that come built-in with Angular, such as `uppercase`, `lowercase`, `date`, `currency`, and others.
- **Custom Pipes:** You can create custom pipes to perform specific transformations that are not available in standard pipes.

### Additional Tips

- **Use Pipes Judiciously:** Avoid overusing pipes as it may impact application performance.
- **Name Pipes Clearly:** If you create custom pipes, name them clearly to reflect their function.
- **Document Pipes:** Document the pipes you create to facilitate understanding and use by others.

**In conclusion,** combining pipes in Angular is a powerful and flexible tool for performing data transformations in templates. By understanding how pipes work and their order, you can create more robust and maintainable Angular applications.
