### **1. Using `new`**

### **The Method**

```typescript
constructor() {
  this.tasksService = new TasksService();
}
```

### **Explanation**

- When you use **`new`**, you are manually creating a **new instance** of the service inside the component or elsewhere.
- The service’s `constructor` is called to initialize the newly created object.
- Every time you use **`new`**, a separate, independent instance of the service is created.

### **Advantages**

1. **Simple and Direct**: Suitable for quickly creating objects.
2. **Independent of Angular**: Can be used in any JavaScript or TypeScript environment (even outside Angular).

### **Disadvantages**

1. **No Singleton**: Each time, a new object is created, meaning data is not shared between components.
   - Example: If one component adds data to the service, another component cannot access the same data because they each have independent instances.
2. **Ignores Angular's Dependency Management**:
   - **Dependency Injection (DI)** is designed to automatically manage the creation and sharing of services.
3. **Harder to Test**:
   - When using `new`, you cannot easily replace the service with a **Mock Service** during unit testing.

### **2. Using Dependency Injection**

### **The Method**

```typescript
constructor(private tasksService: TasksService) {}
```

### **Explanation**

- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used in Angular to manage the creation of objects and provide them to components and other services.
- Angular automatically creates **a single shared instance (Singleton)** of the service and injects it wherever needed.

### **Advantages**

1. **Singleton (Single Shared Instance)**:
   - Only one instance of the service is created and shared across the entire application.
   - This allows for easy sharing of data between components and services.
   - Example: If one component adds data to the service, any other component can access that same data.
2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Angular automatically manages the lifecycle of the service.
   - If the service depends on other services, Angular will also provide and manage those dependencies automatically.
3. **Ease of Testing**:
   - You can easily replace the actual service with a **Mock Service** during unit tests.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     TestBed.configureTestingModule({
       providers: [{ provide: TasksService, useClass: MockTasksService }],
     });
     ```
4. **Cleaner and More Organized Code**:
   - Makes the code less cluttered and easier to maintain.

### **Disadvantages**

- **Angular Dependent**: You cannot easily use DI outside Angular's environment.
- **May Seem Complex for Beginners**: If you're new to Angular, understanding DI might take some time.

### **Comparison Between the Two Methods**

| **Feature**                    | **Using `new`**                                       | **Dependency Injection (DI)**                        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ease of Creation**           | Simple and straightforward                            | Requires DI setup                                    |
| **Dependency Management**      | Manual, you must create dependencies yourself         | Automatically managed by Angular                     |
| **Data Sharing (Singleton)**   | Not possible; each component gets a separate instance | Possible; a single instance is shared across the app |
| **Compatibility with Angular** | Does not depend on Angular                            | Fully integrated with Angular's architecture         |
| **Testing**                    | Hard to replace with a Mock during tests              | Easy to replace with a Mock during tests             |
| **Complexity**                 | Simple but less flexible                              | More complex but powerful and flexible               |

### **Practical Example**

### Using `new`:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  tasksService: TasksService;

  constructor() {
    this.tasksService = new TasksService();
  }

  addTask() {
    this.tasksService.addTask({
      title: "Learn Angular",
      description: "Study Angular basics.",
    });
  }
}
```

- If you create **a second component** and use the same approach, it will not be able to access the data added by the first component because each component has its own separate instance of `TasksService`.

### Using Dependency Injection:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { TasksService } from "./tasks.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"],
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private tasksService: TasksService) {}

  addTask() {
    this.tasksService.addTask({
      title: "Learn Angular",
      description: "Study Angular basics.",
    });
  }
}
```

- Now, if you add a task using this component, any other component using the same `TasksService` can access that task because Angular shares the same instance of the service across the application.

### **Summary**

- **Using `new`** is only suitable for small experiments or projects that don’t fully rely on Angular.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is the preferred approach for real-world applications in Angular:
  - Automatically manages dependencies.
  - Provides a single shared instance (Singleton) of services.
  - Makes the code easier to maintain and test.
