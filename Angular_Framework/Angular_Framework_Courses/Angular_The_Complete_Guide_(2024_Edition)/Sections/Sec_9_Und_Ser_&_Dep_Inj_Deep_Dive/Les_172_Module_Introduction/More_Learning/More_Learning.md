## More Learning:

In **Angular**, **Services** are components used to provide business logic and enable code reuse across multiple components. They are commonly used for tasks such as:

1. **Data Handling**:

   - Fetching data from external APIs using HTTP.
   - Managing local data storage.

2. **Code Reuse**:

   - Writing shared functions used by different components in the application.

3. **State Management**:
   - Storing and sharing the application state between components.

### **How to Create a Service in Angular**

1. **Create a New Service**:
   You can create a service using the Angular CLI with the following command:

   ```bash
   ng generate service service-name
   ```

   This command will generate two files:

   - `service-name.service.ts`: Contains the main service code.
   - `service-name.service.spec.ts`: A test file for the service.

2. **Service Structure**:
   The service file contains TypeScript code. Here's a simple example:

   ```typescript
   import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root", // Makes the service available at the application level.
   })
   export class ExampleService {
     constructor() {}

     getMessage(): string {
       return "Hello from the service!";
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Using the Service in Components**:

   - Import the service into an Angular component:

     ```typescript
     import { Component } from "@angular/core";
     import { ExampleService } from "./example.service";

     @Component({
       selector: "app-example",
       template: `<h1>{{ message }}</h1>`,
     })
     export class ExampleComponent {
       message: string;

       constructor(private exampleService: ExampleService) {
         this.message = this.exampleService.getMessage();
       }
     }
     ```

   - The service is injected into the component using Dependency Injection.

### **Key Notes About Services**

1. **`@Injectable`**:

   - Used to define the service and make it injectable.
   - The `providedIn: 'root'` option means that Angular will create the service at the application level (Singleton).

2. **Scope**:

   - You can specify the scope of the service if you want it to be limited to a specific module instead of the entire application.

3. **Interacting with HTTP**:

   - Services are often used with `HttpClient` to fetch data:

     ```typescript
     import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";

     @Injectable({
       providedIn: "root",
     })
     export class DataService {
       constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

       fetchData(url: string) {
         return this.http.get(url);
       }
     }
     ```

4. **State Management**:
   - Services can be used to store and share state data between components.

### **Summary**

Services are a core part of **Angular** for reducing duplication and improving code organization. They can be used in various scenarios, such as interacting with APIs, managing state, or performing calculations and shared functions.

In **Angular**, **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a core concept that makes the application more flexible and maintainable. **Dependency Injection** is a design pattern that allows components to request the dependencies they need instead of creating them internally.

### **What is Dependency Injection?**

- It is a technique where the required **dependencies** are directly injected into components or services instead of being created inside them.
- Dependencies can be services, objects, or anything that the component needs to function.

### **How Does DI Work in Angular?**

1. **Provider**:

   - When a service or object is defined for injection, it is registered as a **Provider** in Angular.
   - Angular uses the provider to create an instance of the service and make it available to the application.

2. **Injector**:

   - Angular has a system called the **Injector**, which manages the creation and provisioning of dependencies to components.

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Dependencies are injected into components or services using **Constructor Injection**.

### **Why Use Dependency Injection?**

1. **Code Reusability**:

   - Allows sharing the same object (e.g., service) across multiple components.

2. **Separation of Concerns**:

   - The component is not responsible for creating the objects it needs.

3. **Improved Testing**:

   - Makes it easier to test components using mock objects.

4. **Flexibility and Maintainability**:
   - If a dependency changes, you can update it in one place instead of updating it everywhere it's used.

### **How to Use DI in Angular**

#### 1. **Create a Simple Service**:

Create a service using the command:

```bash
ng generate service example
```

#### 2. **Register the Service**:

- Register the service at the application or module level:
  ```typescript
  @Injectable({
    providedIn: "root", // Makes the service available throughout the application.
  })
  export class ExampleService {
    getData() {
      return "Hello from the service!";
    }
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Inject the Service into a Component**:

- Import the service and inject it into the component using the constructor:

  ```typescript
  import { Component } from "@angular/core";
  import { ExampleService } from "./example.service";

  @Component({
    selector: "app-example",
    template: `<h1>{{ message }}</h1>`,
  })
  export class ExampleComponent {
    message: string;

    constructor(private exampleService: ExampleService) {
      this.message = this.exampleService.getData();
    }
  }
  ```

#### 4. **Managing Multiple Dependencies**:

- If multiple services are needed, they can be injected in the same way.

### **Types of Providers in Angular**

1. **`providedIn`**:

   - Specifies where the service is available, such as `'root'` (application-wide) or `'any'` (a new instance for each module).

2. **Module-Level**:

   - Services can be registered in the `providers` section of a module.

3. **Component-Level**:
   - Services can be registered within a component, making them available only to that component and its children.

### **Practical Example**

#### A Service to Provide Data:

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class DataService {
  getData(): string {
    return "Data from the service!";
  }
}
```

#### A Component Using the Service:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { DataService } from "./data.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-data",
  template: `<h1>{{ data }}</h1>`,
})
export class DataComponent {
  data: string;

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {
    this.data = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

### **Summary**

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a fundamental technique in Angular that simplifies dependency management and makes components more reusable and testable. The system relies on registering services as providers, and the injector provides them whenever required by components or other services.

### **Hierarchical Injectors in Angular:**

In Angular, **Hierarchical Injectors** refer to the way dependency injection (DI) systems are organized and used within the application. Each **Injector** acts as a container that manages and provides services.

- **Injector Tree:**  
  When an application is built, a chain of **Injectors** is created in the form of a tree.

  - **Root Injector:** Created at the application level and known as the **Root Injector**.
  - **Child Injectors:** Created for each component or module when needed.

- **Service Inheritance:**  
  Components or modules can access services defined in their **Parent Injector**. If a service is not defined in the **Child Injector**, Angular will look for it in the **Parent Injector**, all the way up to the **Root Injector**.

### **DI Resolution Process:**

When a service is requested using DI in Angular, the following steps occur:

1. **Lookup in the Current Injector:**

   - Angular begins by searching for the requested service in the **Injector** of the current component or module.

2. **Climbing Up:**

   - If the service is not found, Angular moves to the **Parent Injector**.
   - This process continues until it reaches the **Root Injector**.

3. **Throwing an Error:**
   - If the service is not found in any Injector (including the Root Injector), Angular throws a **NullInjectorError**.

### **Example of Hierarchical Injectors:**

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root", // Service is registered in the Root Injector
})
export class ApiService {
  constructor() {
    console.log("ApiService Created");
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: "app-parent",
  template: "<app-child></app-child>",
  providers: [SomeOtherService], // A Child Injector is created with SomeOtherService
})
export class ParentComponent {}

@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: "<p>Child Component</p>",
})
export class ChildComponent {
  constructor(private apiService: ApiService) {}
}
```

#### **Explanation of the Example:**

- **ApiService** is defined in the **Root Injector**, making it available to all components.
- **SomeOtherService** is defined in **ParentComponent** using `providers`, making it available only to **ParentComponent** and its child components (such as **ChildComponent**).

### **Benefits of Hierarchical Injectors:**

1. **Memory Efficiency:** A single instance of a service is created when registered in the Root Injector.
2. **Customizability:** Services can be registered specifically for certain components using Child Injectors.
3. **Precise Control:** The same service can have different configurations in different components.

### **Injection Tokens & Values in Angular**

In Angular, **Injection Tokens** and **Values** are used to provide custom services or values within the **Dependency Injection (DI)** system. Let's explain each concept separately:

### **1. Injection Tokens:**

- **Definition:**  
  In Angular, **Injection Tokens** are used as custom identifiers to inject values or services that are not tied to a specific class. Typically, a class name is used to identify a service, but if we want to provide a value, object, or service that doesn’t have a class, we use **Injection Tokens**.

- **Why Do We Need Injection Tokens?**
  1. If we have multiple services of the same type, we need a way to distinguish them.
  2. If we want to inject simple objects like strings, numbers, or objects.

#### **Example of Using Injection Tokens:**

```typescript
import { InjectionToken } from "@angular/core";

// Create an Injection Token
export const API_URL = new InjectionToken<string>("API_URL");

// Register the value in the Root Injector
@NgModule({
  providers: [{ provide: API_URL, useValue: "https://api.example.com" }],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### **Using Injection Token inside a Component:**

```typescript
import { Component, Inject } from "@angular/core";
import { API_URL } from "./app.module";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  template: `<p>API URL: {{ apiUrl }}</p>`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(API_URL) public apiUrl: string) {}
}
```

#### **Explanation of the Example:**

- We created an **Injection Token** named `API_URL`.
- It is registered with a constant value (`useValue`) in the `AppModule`.
- We can now inject this value into any component using the `@Inject` decorator with the token identifier.

### **2. Values:**

- **Definition:**  
  **Values** are the actual values registered in the DI system, such as objects, strings, or numbers. These values can be provided using **Injection Tokens**.

#### **Examples of Providing Values:**

1. **Providing a simple string:**

   ```typescript
   providers: [{ provide: "AppTitle", useValue: "My Angular App" }];
   ```

2. **Providing an object:**

   ```typescript
   providers: [
     {
       provide: "AppConfig",
       useValue: { apiEndpoint: "https://api.example.com", timeout: 3000 },
     },
   ];
   ```

3. **Using the value inside a component:**
   ```typescript
   constructor(@Inject('AppTitle') public title: string) {}
   ```

### **Notes:**

1. **Injection Tokens vs String Tokens:**  
   If you use a string (`'AppTitle'`) directly as an identifier, there may be conflicts if similar identifiers exist.  
   Therefore, it's recommended to use **Injection Tokens** because they are unique.

2. **Injecting custom values:**  
   Values can be simple (like strings or numbers) or complex objects.

### **Summary:**

- **Injection Tokens** are used to provide custom services or values in a unique and safe way.
- **Values** are the actual data or objects registered in the DI system using these tokens.
- This approach helps organize code and makes services and values reusable.
