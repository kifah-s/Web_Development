## More Learning:

In **Angular**, the concept of **Dependency Injection (DI)** is one of the core principles that make the application more maintainable and testable. This mechanism is used to manage the dependencies (such as services or components) that the application needs, instead of creating them manually.

### What is Dependency Injection?

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a **design pattern** where dependencies (like objects or services) are provided to a component or class instead of being created within that component itself. In Angular, dependencies are managed by the **Injector**, which is responsible for creating and providing these objects where needed.

### How Does DI Work in Angular?

1. **Declaring Dependencies:**
   Dependencies are defined as **Services** using the `@Injectable` decorator. These services are made available to your application based on a specific **scope** (Global or Local).

   ```typescript
   import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root", // Makes the service available throughout the application
   })
   export class MyService {
     getMessage() {
       return "Hello from MyService!";
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Registering Dependencies:**
   Services are registered with the **Injector**. Angular automatically registers services when using `@Injectable` with the `providedIn: 'root'` option. If you want to register the service manually, you can add it to the `providers` array in an **NgModule**.

   ```typescript
   @NgModule({
     providers: [MyService], // Manually registering the service in the NgModule
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```

3. **Injecting Dependencies:**
   Dependencies are injected into components or other services via the **constructor**. Angular automatically provides the appropriate objects based on their type.

   ```typescript
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";
   import { MyService } from "./my-service.service";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-root",
     template: `<h1>{{ message }}</h1>`,
   })
   export class AppComponent {
     message: string;

     constructor(private myService: MyService) {
       this.message = this.myService.getMessage(); // Using the service
     }
   }
   ```

### Benefits of Dependency Injection in Angular

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   DI separates the code that uses dependencies from the code that creates them, leading to cleaner and more organized code.

2. **Reusability:**
   The same service can be reused across multiple components effortlessly.

3. **Unit Testing:**
   DI makes testing components and services easier because you can replace dependencies with **mock objects** during testing.

4. **Lifecycle Management:**
   Angular's Injector automatically manages the creation and destruction of dependencies based on their **scope**.

### Types of Injectors in Angular

1. **Root Injector:**
   Responsible for providing dependencies globally across the entire application. It is created when the application starts.

2. **Hierarchical Injectors:**
   Allows creating local services at the component level (Component-Level Services), making the service available only within the component's scope.

### Practical Example of Hierarchical Injectors

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable()
export class LocalService {
  getMessage() {
    return "Hello from LocalService!";
  }
}

import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-local",
  template: `<h2>{{ message }}</h2>`,
  providers: [LocalService], // Registering the service at the component level
})
export class LocalComponent {
  message: string;

  constructor(private localService: LocalService) {
    this.message = this.localService.getMessage();
  }
}
```

In the example above:

- **LocalService** is only available to the `LocalComponent` and not to other components.

### Summary

**Dependency Injection** is a system for managing dependencies that makes Angular applications flexible and maintainable. Thanks to this mechanism, business logic can be separated from components, resulting in better application design and improved testability.
