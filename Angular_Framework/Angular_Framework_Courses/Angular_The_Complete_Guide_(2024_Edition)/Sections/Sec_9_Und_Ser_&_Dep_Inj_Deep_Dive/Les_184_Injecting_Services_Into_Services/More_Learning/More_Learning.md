## More Learning:

In **Angular**, when you need to use a service inside another service, this is known as **Injecting Services Into Services** or **Service Injection**.  
This is done using **Dependency Injection (DI)**, a design pattern that allows managing dependencies between objects in a flexible way.

## üí° Why Do We Need Injecting Services Into Services?

Sometimes, a service depends on another service to perform certain tasks.  
For example, an `AuthService` might need a `LoggerService` to log login and logout actions.

## üî• How to Inject a Service into Another Service?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the First Service (`LoggerService`)

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class LoggerService {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log("LoggerService:", message);
  }
}
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Second Service (`AuthService`) and Inject `LoggerService` into It

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { LoggerService } from "./logger.service"; // Import the other service

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class AuthService {
  constructor(private logger: LoggerService) {}

  login(username: string) {
    this.logger.log(`User ${username} logged in.`);
    // Login logic
  }

  logout() {
    this.logger.log("User logged out.");
    // Logout logic
  }
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Use `AuthService` in a Component

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { AuthService } from "./auth.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-login",
  template: `<button (click)="login()">Login</button>`,
})
export class LoginComponent {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  login() {
    this.authService.login("JohnDoe");
  }
}
```

## üõ† Important Notes:

- The service to be injected (like `LoggerService`) must be provided using `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` so that Angular can manage it.
- The service is injected into the **constructor** of the other service, allowing it to be used inside it.
- This pattern helps reduce repetition (DRY principle) and improves **service management and code modularity**.

## üéØ When Should We Use Injecting Services Into Services?

‚úÖ When a service needs the functionality of another service (such as event logging, authentication, or data handling).  
‚úÖ When dealing with complex logic and you want to break it down into **smaller, well-organized services**.

## Injecting Services into Services: A Core Concept in Angular

In Angular, services are classes used to organize and share code between application components. Services can contain various functionalities, such as fetching data from a server, processing data, or managing application state.

When a service needs to use another service, we employ a technique called "Dependency Injection" to inject the required service into the dependent service. This allows us to separate concerns and make the code more maintainable and testable.

## How Does Injecting Services into Services Work?

1.  **Create the Dependent Service:** First, we create the service to be injected. For example, this service could be responsible for logging messages to the console.

    ```typescript
    import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

    @Injectable({
      providedIn: "root",
    })
    export class LoggingService {
      logMessage(message: string) {
        console.log(message);
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Create the Service That Depends on the Dependent Service:** Next, we create the service that will depend on the dependent service. In this service, we specify the dependent service in the service's constructor.

    ```typescript
    import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
    import { LoggingService } from "./logging.service";

    @Injectable({
      providedIn: "root",
    })
    export class DataService {
      constructor(private loggingService: LoggingService) {}

      getData() {
        this.loggingService.logMessage("Getting data...");
        // ... Fetch data ...
        this.loggingService.logMessage("Data received.");
        return "Data";
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Use the Injected Service:** Now, we can use the injected service within the dependent service. In the example above, `DataService` uses the `LoggingService` to log messages to the console.

## Benefits of Injecting Services into Services

- **Reusability:** Services can be reused in different parts of the application.
- **Testability:** Services can be tested independently of each other.
- **Maintainability:** Makes the code more maintainable and modifiable.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Separates the different concerns of the application, making the code more organized.

## Practical Example

Let's say we have an application that displays a list of products. We want to create a service to fetch products from the server and another service to log messages to the console.

1.  **Create the Product Fetching Service:**

    ```typescript
    import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
    import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";

    @Injectable({
      providedIn: "root",
    })
    export class ProductService {
      constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

      getProducts() {
        return this.http.get("https://api.example.com/products");
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Create the Message Logging Service:**

    ```typescript
    import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

    @Injectable({
      providedIn: "root",
    })
    export class LoggingService {
      logMessage(message: string) {
        console.log(message);
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Use the Services in the Component:**

    ```typescript
    import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
    import { ProductService } from "./product.service";
    import { LoggingService } from "./logging.service";

    @Component({
      selector: "app-product-list",
      template: `
        <ul>
          <li *ngFor="let product of products">{{ product.name }}</li>
        </ul>
      `,
    })
    export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit {
      products: any[] = [];

      constructor(
        private productService: ProductService,
        private loggingService: LoggingService
      ) {}

      ngOnInit() {
        this.loggingService.logMessage("Fetching products...");
        this.productService.getProducts().subscribe((products) => {
          this.products = products;
          this.loggingService.logMessage("Products fetched successfully.");
        });
      }
    }
    ```

In this example, `ProductListComponent` uses both `ProductService` and `LoggingService` to fetch products and log messages to the console.

In Angular, **Services** are objects used to organize and share logic or data across the application. Often, we need to use one service inside another to achieve code reuse or to divide tasks in an organized manner. This is where the concept of **service injection** comes into play.

### What is Injecting Services Into Services?

Injecting services means making a specific service (Service A) available for use within another service (Service B) through Angular‚Äôs **Dependency Injection (DI)** system. This system allows you to manage dependencies between objects easily without needing to manually create instances.

### How Does It Work in Angular?

1. **Creating Services**: First, you create the services you want to use, either with Angular CLI or manually using classes with the `@Injectable()` decorator.
2. **Providing the Service**: The service to be injected must be registered in Angular‚Äôs DI system, typically by adding it to the `providedIn` property within `@Injectable()` or in the `providers` array of a module.
3. **Injection**: You inject the service into the other service using the constructor.

### Practical Example

Suppose we have a service to manage user data (UserService) and another service for logging activities (LoggingService), and we want to use LoggingService inside UserService.

#### Step 1: Creating the Services

```typescript
// logging.service.ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root", // Makes the service globally available
})
export class LoggingService {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log(`Log: ${message}`);
  }
}

// user.service.ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { LoggingService } from "./logging.service";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class UserService {
  constructor(private loggingService: LoggingService) {} // Injecting LoggingService here

  getUser() {
    this.loggingService.log("User data fetched");
    return { name: "Ahmed", age: 30 };
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Using the Service in a Component

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { UserService } from "./user.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  template: `<p>Hello {{ user.name }}</p>`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  user: any;

  constructor(private userService: UserService) {
    this.user = this.userService.getUser();
  }
}
```

### Result

When running the application, a message will appear in the console:  
`Log: User data fetched`  
This indicates that `LoggingService` was successfully injected into `UserService` and used.

### Why Use Service Injection?

1. **Reusability**: You can reuse the service logic in multiple places.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: It helps divide the code into smaller, maintainable units.
3. **Ease of Testing**: Thanks to DI, you can easily replace services during testing (e.g., using Mock Services).

### Important Notes

- Ensure the service you want to inject has the appropriate scope (e.g., `providedIn: 'root'` or in a specific module).
- If the service isn‚Äôt registered in the DI system, you‚Äôll get a runtime error.
- You can inject multiple services into the same constructor if needed.
