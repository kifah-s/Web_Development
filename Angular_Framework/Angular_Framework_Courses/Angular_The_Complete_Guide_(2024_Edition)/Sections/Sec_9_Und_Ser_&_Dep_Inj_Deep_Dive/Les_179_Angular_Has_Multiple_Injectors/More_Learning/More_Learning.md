In **Angular**, **Injectors** are responsible for providing **dependencies** within the application. They use **Dependency Injection (DI)** to manage the objects required by components and services. There are several types of **Injectors** in Angular:

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Root Injector**

- **Level:** Entire application.
- **Configuration:** Created when the application starts.
- **Location:** Services defined with `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` or in the `providers` array inside `AppModule`.
- **Advantages:** Any service registered here will be **Singleton** (a single instance throughout the application).
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  @Injectable({
    providedIn: "root",
  })
  export class MyService {}
  ```
  - This means `MyService` will be available throughout the application.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Module-Level Injector**

- **Level:** A specific module.
- **Configuration:** Services are defined in the `providers` array inside `@NgModule` in a **Module**.
- **Advantages:**
  - A separate instance of the service is created for each **Module** that imports it.
  - If the module is loaded via **Lazy Loading**, a new instance of the service will be created specifically for that module.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  @NgModule({
    providers: [MyService],
  })
  export class MyModule {}
  ```

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Component-Level Injector**

- **Level:** A specific component.
- **Configuration:** Services are defined inside the `providers` array in `@Component`.
- **Advantages:**
  - A new instance of the service is created each time the component is instantiated.
  - If multiple instances of the component exist, each gets its own unique instance of the service.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  @Component({
    selector: "app-example",
    templateUrl: "./example.component.html",
    providers: [MyService],
  })
  export class ExampleComponent {
    constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
  }
  ```
  - Here, each time `ExampleComponent` is created, a **new instance** of `MyService` is generated.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Directive-Level Injector**

- **Level:** A specific directive.
- **Configuration:** Similar to components, defined inside the `providers` array in `@Directive`.
- **Advantages:**
  - Each element using the directive gets its own independent instance of the service.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  @Directive({
    selector: "[appHighlight]",
    providers: [HighlightService],
  })
  export class HighlightDirective {
    constructor(private highlightService: HighlightService) {}
  }
  ```
  - Here, every element with the `appHighlight` directive will have a unique instance of `HighlightService`.

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Element Injector**

- **Level:** A specific DOM element.
- **Configuration:** Automatically determined when child components are inserted into a parent component.
- **Advantages:**
  - Enables dependency propagation within the **component hierarchy**.
  - If an element does not have its own injector, it looks up the **hierarchy** to find a suitable injector.
- **Example:**

  ```typescript
  @Component({
    selector: "app-parent",
    template: "<app-child></app-child>",
    providers: [MyService],
  })
  export class ParentComponent {}

  @Component({
    selector: "app-child",
    template: "Child Component",
  })
  export class ChildComponent {
    constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
  }
  ```

  - In this example, `ChildComponent` will get `MyService` from `ParentComponent`.

### ðŸ”¹ **Hierarchy of Injectors**

```
Root Injector
  â”œâ”€â”€ Module Injector
  â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ Component Injector
  â”‚     â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ Element Injector
  â”‚     â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ Directive Injector
```

- Each injector looks for dependencies at its own level, and if not found, it searches **up the hierarchy** until it reaches the `Root Injector`.

### âš¡ When to Use Each Type?

âœ… **Root Injector (`providedIn: 'root'`)** â†’ When you need a **shared** service across the entire application.  
âœ… **Module Injector (`providers` in `@NgModule`)** â†’ When you need a service scoped to a specific module, such as in **Lazy Loading**.  
âœ… **Component Injector (`providers` in `@Component`)** â†’ When you need a new instance of the service for each component instance.  
âœ… **Directive Injector (`providers` in `@Directive`)** â†’ When you need a service for each element using the directive.

This approach allows you to efficiently manage services within an **Angular** application! ðŸš€
