In Angular, the `@Input` decorator is used to define properties that a component can receive from another component. This is very useful when you need to pass data from a parent component to a child component, enabling reusability and allowing communication between components.

### How to Use @Input

1. **Define an @Input Property in the Child Component:**

   - In the child component, define the property where you want to receive data and add `@Input` before it.

   ```typescript
   // child.component.ts
   import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-child",
     template: `<p>Message from parent: {{ message }}</p>`,
   })
   export class ChildComponent {
     @Input() message: string; // Define property with @Input
   }
   ```

2. **Pass Data from the Parent to the Child Component:**

   - In the parent component, use the child component’s tag (`<app-child>`) with the `[message]` property to pass the value.

   ```html
   <!-- parent.component.html -->
   <app-child [message]="'Hello from parent component'"></app-child>
   ```

   Here, the text `'Hello from parent component'` is passed to the `message` property in the child component.

3. **Display the Data in the Child Component:**
   - Inside the child component’s template, you can display the received data using `{{ message }}`.

### How @Input Works

When you use `@Input`, Angular checks for any value passed from the parent component and automatically assigns it to the child component when data in the parent is updated.

### Practical Example

Suppose you have a product list component (`ProductListComponent`) that displays multiple products, and each product is displayed in a separate component (`ProductItemComponent`). You can use `@Input` to pass product details from `ProductListComponent` to `ProductItemComponent`.

**Code in `ProductItemComponent`:**

```typescript
// product-item.component.ts
import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-product-item",
  template: `<div>{{ product.name }} - {{ product.price }}</div>`,
})
export class ProductItemComponent {
  @Input() product: { name: string; price: number };
}
```

**Code in `ProductListComponent`:**

```html
<!-- product-list.component.html -->
<app-product-item
  *ngFor="let item of products"
  [product]="item"
></app-product-item>
```

### Benefits

`@Input` allows you to create flexible, reusable components, as you can pass in data as needed from other components.

The **@Input** decorator in Angular is a powerful mechanism that allows you to pass data from a parent component to a child component. In other words, it acts as a communication channel that enables the parent component to pass specific values to the child component for its internal use.

### Why use @Input?

- **Separation of Concerns:** Helps separate the logic of the components, as the parent component focuses on providing data, while the child component focuses on displaying or processing it.
- **Reusability:** The same child component can be used in multiple places with different data, increasing code reusability.
- **Component Interaction:** Provides an easy way for components to interact and exchange data.

### How to use @Input?

1. **Define the property in the child component:**

   ```typescript
   import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-child",
     templateUrl: "./child.component.html",
     styleUrls: ["./child.component.css"],
   })
   export class ChildComponent {
     @Input() childName: string;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `childName` property of type string is defined using the `@Input` decorator. This property will be used to receive a value from the parent component.

2. **Pass the value from the parent component:**
   ```html
   <app-child [childName]="parentData"></app-child>
   ```
   In the parent component's template, `[childName]` is used to bind the `childName` property in the child component to the `parentData` variable in the parent component.

### Practical Example:

```typescript
// parent.component.ts
export class ParentComponent {
  parentData = 'Hello from parent';
}

// child.component.ts
@Component({ ... })
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() childName: string;
}

// parent.component.html
<app-child [childName]="parentData"></app-child>

// child.component.html
<p>Hello, {{ childName }}!</p>
```

In this example, the text "Hello from parent" will be displayed inside the child component because the value of `parentData` is passed to the `childName` property.

### Important Notes:

- **Data Type:** The data type of the property in the child component must match the data type of the value passed from the parent component.
- **Names:** The names of the properties in the two components do not have to match, but the binding is done through the `[childName]` attribute in the parent component's template.
- **Changes:** When the value of the property in the parent component changes, the value of the property in the child component will be updated automatically.

### Summary

The `@Input` decorator is a fundamental tool in Angular for passing data between components. It makes your application structure clearer and simplifies component reuse.
