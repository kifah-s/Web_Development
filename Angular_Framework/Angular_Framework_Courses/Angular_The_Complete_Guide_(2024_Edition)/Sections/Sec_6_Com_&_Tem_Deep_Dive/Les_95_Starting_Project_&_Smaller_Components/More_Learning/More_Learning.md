In **Angular**, component splitting is essential for building organized and maintainable applications. Here are some situations where it's beneficial to split components:

### 1. **Reusability:**

If a part of the UI is used in multiple places, consider making it a standalone component so it can be reused anywhere else, like buttons or data tables.

### 2. **Complexity:**

When a component becomes complex and contains a lot of code, splitting it into smaller components improves readability and maintainability. For example, if you have a large form, you could divide it into subcomponents for different fields.

### 3. **Separation of Concerns:**

When a specific part of the code needs to focus on a single task, isolating it as an independent component helps. For example, if you have an item list and a filtering system, you could separate the item list into its own component and the filtering into another.

### 4. **Visual Management:**

Components help break down the UI, making it easier to control the layout and responsiveness, which is useful for applications with complex UIs.

### 5. **Testability:**

Splitting components also improves testability; smaller components are easier to test independently.

### 6. **Data Separation:**

When a section of the UI interacts independently with specific data, creating a component that manages that data alone is beneficial, especially for applications using services to fetch data.

### 7. **Performance:**

Component splitting can improve app performance by only loading specific parts when needed. This can reduce the initial load time and enhance user experience.

### Summary:

The best practice is to keep each component relatively small, with a clear purpose and reusable design.

Dividing components in Angular is a design technique that helps build more organized, maintainable, and reusable web applications. But when is this division necessary? Here are some situations that prompt you to consider dividing a component in Angular:

- **Component Complexity:**
  - **Too many responsibilities:** When a single component becomes responsible for a lot of logic and design, it becomes difficult to understand and modify.
  - **Code size:** If a component contains a lot of code, it becomes slower and more prone to errors.
  - **Difficulty in testing:** Large and complex components are difficult to test individually.
- **Reusability:**
  - **Repeated parts:** If you have parts of the user interface that are repeated in multiple places, it is best to turn them into separate components.
  - **Ready-made components:** Simple components can be reused to build more complex components.
- **Application Maintenance:**
  - **Local changes:** When making changes to a specific part of the application, dividing components makes these changes easier and safer.
  - **Collaboration between developers:** Dividing components makes it easier for the development team to work independently on different parts of the application.
- **Performance Improvement:**
  - **Lazy loading:** Large components can be lazily loaded when needed, which improves application performance.
  - **Targeted optimization:** The performance of a specific component can be improved without affecting the rest of the application.
- **Abstract Logic:**
  - **Separating logic from presentation:** Abstract logic (data, operations) should be separated from the presentation (user interface) in separate components.

**When should you not divide components?**

- **Simple components:** There is no need to divide a simple component that contains only a line or two of code.
- **Performance:** In some cases, dividing components may degrade performance due to an increase in component creation and destruction operations.

**General tips for dividing components:**

- **Start small:** Gradually divide components into smaller parts.
- **Use clear criteria:** Set clear criteria for dividing components, such as single responsibility, code size, or reusability.
- **Think about the future:** When designing components, think about how they can be expanded and reused in the future.
- **Use assistive tools:** There are many tools that can help you divide components, such as code analysis tools.

**In summary, dividing components is an important design decision that should be made carefully. The goal should be to build more organized, maintainable, and reusable web applications.**
