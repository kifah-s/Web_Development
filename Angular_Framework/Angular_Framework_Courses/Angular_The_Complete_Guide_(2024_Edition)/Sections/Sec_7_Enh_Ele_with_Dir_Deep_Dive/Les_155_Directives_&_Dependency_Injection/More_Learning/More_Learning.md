## More Learning:

### **1. Directives in Angular:**

**Directives** are instructions used to extend the behavior of DOM elements in Angular. They can be categorized into three main types:

#### **A. Attribute Directives:**

- Modify or change the behavior of existing elements by altering their attributes or properties.

##### **Examples:**

1. **ngClass**: Dynamically change the CSS class.

   ```html
   <div [ngClass]="{'active': isActive, 'inactive': !isActive}">Content</div>
   ```

2. **ngStyle**: Dynamically apply CSS styles.
   ```html
   <div [ngStyle]="{'color': isRed ? 'red' : 'blue'}">Styled Text</div>
   ```

#### **B. Structural Directives:**

- Change the DOM structure by adding or removing elements.

##### **Examples:**

1. **ngIf**: Show or hide elements.

   ```html
   <div *ngIf="isVisible">This is visible</div>
   ```

2. **ngFor**: Iterate over a collection.

   ```html
   <ul>
     <li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</li>
   </ul>
   ```

3. **ngSwitch**: Apply multiple conditions.
   ```html
   <div [ngSwitch]="status">
     <p *ngSwitchCase="'active'">Active</p>
     <p *ngSwitchCase="'inactive'">Inactive</p>
     <p *ngSwitchDefault>Unknown</p>
   </div>
   ```

#### **C. Custom Directives:**

You can create your own directives to extend functionality.

##### **Example:**

Creating a directive that changes the background color on mouse hover:

1. **TypeScript:**

   ```typescript
   import { Directive, ElementRef, HostListener } from "@angular/core";

   @Directive({
     selector: "[appHighlight]",
   })
   export class HighlightDirective {
     constructor(private el: ElementRef) {}

     @HostListener("mouseenter") onMouseEnter() {
       this.highlight("yellow");
     }

     @HostListener("mouseleave") onMouseLeave() {
       this.highlight("");
     }

     private highlight(color: string) {
       this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = color;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **HTML:**
   ```html
   <p appHighlight>Hover over me to change background color!</p>
   ```

### **2. Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular:**

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to manage object dependencies within an application. Angular relies on it to provide objects and services in an organized and easy way.

#### **DI Concept:**

Instead of a component creating the objects it needs, they are **injected** by an **Injector**, which provides objects on demand.

#### **Benefits of DI:**

1. **Reduces redundancy:** Provides a reusable singleton object.
2. **Easier testing:** Allows easy replacement of objects during testing.
3. **Separation of concerns:** Reduces component dependency on internal service logic.

#### **How DI Works in Angular:**

##### **1. Define a Service:**

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root", // Makes the service available application-wide
})
export class DataService {
  getData() {
    return ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"];
  }
}
```

##### **2. Use the Service in a Component:**

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { DataService } from "./data.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-demo",
  template: `<ul>
    <li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</li>
  </ul>`,
})
export class DemoComponent implements OnInit {
  items: string[] = [];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.items = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

### **Conclusion:**

- **Directives** allow you to control the behavior and design of DOM elements.
- **Dependency Injection** simplifies the management of object dependencies and services, making the code more organized, maintainable, and testable.

> By leveraging both features, you can build powerful and flexible applications in **Angular**.

### Directives and Dependency Injection in Angular ..

### Directives:

**What are Directives in Angular?**

Directives are reusable templates that are added to existing HTML elements to enhance their behavior or appearance. In other words, they provide a mechanism to define new behavior for existing HTML elements.

**Types of Directives:**

- **Component Directives:** These are the foundation of Angular components. Every component is a directive that adds new behavior to an HTML element.
- **Attribute Directives:** These are added as attributes to HTML elements to change the appearance or behavior of the element itself or its descendants.
- **Structural Directives:** These modify the DOM (Document Object Model) structure by adding or removing elements.

**Examples of Directives:**

- **ngIf:** Used to add or remove an element from the DOM based on a condition.
- **ngFor:** Used to repeat an HTML element a specified number of times.
- **ngClass:** Used to change the CSS classes of an element based on a condition.
- **Custom Directives:** You can create custom directives to meet your specific application needs.

**Why use Directives?**

- **Reusability:** Directives can be reused in multiple components.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Separates concerns between HTML structure and behavior.
- **Maintainability:** Directive behavior can be modified in one place, and the changes are reflected everywhere the directive is used.

### Dependency Injection:

**What is Dependency Injection?**

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that separates the creation of objects from their use. In Angular, DI is used to inject services or other components into a component. In other words, instead of a component creating the dependencies it needs, these dependencies are passed to it when the component is created.

**Why use Dependency Injection?**

- **Testing:** Makes it easier to isolate components and test them independently.
- **Reusability:** Services can be reused in multiple components.
- **Code Maintainability:** Makes code more readable and maintainable.

**How does Dependency Injection work in Angular?**

1. **Service Registration:** Services are registered in the service provider.
2. **Dependency Injection:** Dependencies are injected into the constructor or a property of the component.
3. **Angular Creates Dependencies:** When a component is created, Angular creates the registered dependencies and injects them into the component.

**Example of Dependency Injection:**

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { DataService } from "./data.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-my-component",
  templateUrl: "./my-component.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./my-component.component.css"],
})
export class MyComponent {
  data: any;

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {
    this.data = dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

In this example, the `DataService` is injected into the `MyComponent`. The `DataService` provides data that is displayed in the component.

**Connecting Directives and Dependency Injection:**

Dependency Injection can be used to inject services into custom directives. For example, a custom directive can be created to validate a form and use a service to validate the data.

**In conclusion,** Directives and Dependency Injection are fundamental concepts in Angular. They enable you to build robust, flexible, and reusable Angular applications. By understanding these concepts, you can build efficient Angular components and better organize your application's structure.

Angular is a powerful framework for developing web interfaces, and two of its fundamental concepts are **Directives** and **Dependency Injection**. Let's take a look at each:

### Directives:

**Directives** in Angular are instructions in the DOM (Document Object Model) that tell Angular to change the appearance or behavior of a DOM element, or the DOM itself. There are three main types of Directives:

1. **Component Directives**: These are the most commonly used. They are used to create Components, which combine templates, styles, and behavior. Every Component is a type of Directive.

2. **Structural Directives**: These change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing DOM elements. Examples include `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`.

3. **Attribute Directives**: These change the appearance or behavior of a DOM element. For instance, `ngClass` and `ngStyle`.

### Dependency Injection:

**Dependency Injection** (DI) is a technique for providing dependencies to various parts of an application. The idea is to separate the creation of dependencies from their usage, which enhances maintainability and testability.

In Angular, **DI** is used to provide services to components and other classes. When a component needs a service, it can "inject" that service into its constructor:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { MyService } from "./my.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-my-component",
  templateUrl: "./my-component.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./my-component.component.css"],
})
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.myService.doSomething();
  }
}
```

Here, `MyComponent` depends on `MyService`, and `MyService` is provided by Angular's DI.
