### 1. **Import:**

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
```

- This line imports `Component` from the `@angular/core` library.
- `Component` is a decorator in Angular used to define the components of the application.

### 2. **Component Decorator:**

```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-header',
    standalone: true,
    templateUrl: './header.component.html',
})
```

- `@Component` is a decorator used to define an Angular component.
- **`selector`**:
  - Specifies the name of the component that can be used in HTML. In this example, the component is named `'app-header'`, and can be inserted in HTML pages as a custom HTML element with this name.
  - Example: `<app-header></app-header>`
- **`standalone`**:
  - Indicates that the component is "standalone" and doesnâ€™t depend on an external module. This is a new feature in Angular 14 that allows you to create components without the need to declare them in a module.
- **`templateUrl`**:
  - Points to the HTML file that contains the template for this component. Here, the template is located in `'./header.component.html'`.

### 3. **Component Class:**

```typescript
export class HeaderComponent {}
```

- Here, the **class** for the component is defined.
- **`HeaderComponent`** is the class that represents this component and would contain any logic needed to interact with users, manage data, etc.
- In this example, the class is empty, which means no logic has been added yet. However, you can add properties or methods as needed.

### How does this component work?

1. When the `<app-header></app-header>` component is called in any part of the application, the content from the `header.component.html` file is rendered.
2. You can add any HTML, links, or even data binding and user interactions in that file.
