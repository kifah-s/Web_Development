In **Angular**, the **`ngSubmit`** directive is used to handle the event that occurs when a form is submitted. This directive listens to the `submit` event on an HTML form and triggers a specific function when the form is submitted.

### **Explanation of `ngSubmit`:**

`ngSubmit` is a directive in Angular applied to the `form` element. When the form is submitted (either by clicking a submit button or pressing Enter inside the form), the function linked to `ngSubmit` is called.

Instead of using the traditional `submit` event in HTML, which may cause a page reload by default, **`ngSubmit`** allows you to handle form submissions in a more controlled way within your Angular application without reloading the page.

### **Example of using `ngSubmit`:**

In this example, we'll create a simple form that is submitted when the user presses the submit button, and the submitted data is handled by a specific function.

#### **1. HTML Template:**

```html
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()" #formDirective="ngForm">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" ngModel required />

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

- **(ngSubmit)="onSubmit()"**: This binds the form's submit event to the `onSubmit()` function, which will be called when the form is submitted.
- **ngModel**: This is used to bind the input values to the form and make it model-driven.
- **#formDirective="ngForm"**: This allows you to access the form's properties in the code.

#### **2. TypeScript:**

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-form-example",
  templateUrl: "./form-example.component.html",
})
export class FormExampleComponent {
  onSubmit() {
    console.log("Form has been submitted!");
  }
}
```

- **onSubmit()**: This function is called when the form is submitted. In this example, it logs a message to the console.

### **Features of `ngSubmit`:**

1. **Prevents automatic page reload**: When using `ngSubmit`, page reloading is prevented by default. Unlike the traditional `submit` event where you would need to use `event.preventDefault()` to stop the reload.
2. **Integration with forms**: `ngSubmit` can easily handle data bound to the form using either `ngModel` or **Reactive Forms** in Angular.

3. **Form validation handling**: `ngSubmit` can be combined with form validation. For example, you can include a condition in the submit function to check if all fields are correctly filled out before submitting the form.

### **Integration with Reactive Forms:**

If you're using Reactive Forms instead of `ngModel`, `ngSubmit` can still be used in a similar manner.

#### **Example with Reactive Forms:**

```html
<form [formGroup]="myForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input id="name" formControlName="name" />

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

#### **TypeScript:**

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { FormGroup, FormBuilder } from "@angular/forms";

@Component({
  selector: "app-reactive-form",
  templateUrl: "./reactive-form.component.html",
})
export class ReactiveFormComponent {
  myForm: FormGroup;

  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {
    this.myForm = this.fb.group({
      name: [""],
    });
  }

  onSubmit() {
    console.log(this.myForm.value); // Handling submitted data
  }
}
```

### **Summary:**

- `ngSubmit` is an Angular directive used to handle form submission events.
- It prevents the default page reload and allows you to submit the form and interact with the submitted data in a custom way.
- It can be used with both **Template-driven forms** or **Reactive forms** depending on the project's needs.

**What is ngSubmit?**

`ngSubmit` is a built-in Angular directive that is used with the `<form>` element to execute a specific function when the form is submitted. In other words, when a user clicks the "Submit" button or presses Enter within the form, the function specified in the `ngSubmit` attribute is executed.

**How does it work?**

1. **Specifying the Function:** Inside the `ngSubmit` attribute of the `<form>` element, you specify the name of the function you want to execute when the form is submitted.
2. **Function Execution:** When the form is submitted, the specified function is called automatically, and an object containing the values of all fields in the form is passed as an argument to the function.
3. **Data Processing:** Inside the function, you can process the data submitted from the form, such as sending it to a server or storing it locally.

**Example:**

```html
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(myForm)">
  <input type="text" name="username" [(ngModel)]="username" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```typescript
// In component.ts file
onSubmit(form: NgForm) {
  console.log(form.value); // Will print the field values to the console
  // Here you can send the data to the server or process it in other ways
}
```

**In this example:**

- When the "Submit" button is clicked, the `onSubmit` function is called.
- The `form` object is passed to the function, which contains all the values of the fields in the form.
- Inside the function, you can access the value of the `username` field using `form.value.username`.

**Uses of ngSubmit:**

- **Submitting forms to the server:** `ngSubmit` is commonly used to send form data to the server using HTTP services.
- **Validating data:** Before submitting the form, you can validate the data entered by the user.
- **Executing other operations:** You can use `ngSubmit` to perform any other type of operation, such as opening a new window, updating data in a database, or executing any other logic you want.

**Important Notes:**

- **NgForm:** The `NgForm` interface is imported from `@angular/forms` for use with `ngSubmit`.
- **[(ngModel)]:** Used to synchronize the value of the field in the form with the value of the variable in the component.
- **Form validation:** You can use built-in Angular features for form validation, such as `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, and others.

**Why use ngSubmit?**

- **Simplifies form handling:** `ngSubmit` provides an easy and clear way to handle form submissions.
- **Separation of concerns:** Separates form processing logic from the view, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Integration with other Angular features:** `ngSubmit` can be easily integrated with other Angular features such as `Reactive Forms` and `template-driven forms`.
