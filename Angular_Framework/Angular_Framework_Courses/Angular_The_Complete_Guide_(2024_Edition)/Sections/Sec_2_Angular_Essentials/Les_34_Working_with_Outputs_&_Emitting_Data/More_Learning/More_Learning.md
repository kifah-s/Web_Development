## More Learning:

In Angular, **`Outputs`** and **`Emitting Data`** refer to the mechanism of passing data from child components to parent components using custom events.

### 1. **`@Output()`**:

- **`@Output()`** is a decorator in Angular used to define a custom event in the child component that the parent component can listen to.
- It is typically used when the child component needs to send data or notify the parent component when a specific event occurs, like clicking a button.

### 2. **`EventEmitter`**:

- **`EventEmitter`** is an object used to emit data or events from the child component to the parent component.
- With `EventEmitter`, you can emit the event and pass data from the child to the parent.

### How to Use `@Output()` and `EventEmitter` to Pass Data:

#### Basic Steps:

1. In the child component, create an event using `@Output()` and `EventEmitter`.
2. Emit the event with the data you want to send using the `emit()` function.
3. In the parent component, listen to the event using the `(eventName)` syntax in the template and handle the received data.

### Practical Example:

#### 1. In the Child Component:

```typescript
import { Component, Output, EventEmitter } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: `<button (click)="sendData()">Send Data to Parent</button>`,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  // Define the custom event using Output and EventEmitter
  @Output() dataEmitter = new EventEmitter<string>();

  sendData() {
    // Emit the event and pass the data
    this.dataEmitter.emit("Data from Child Component!");
  }
}
```

- In this example, when the user clicks the button in the child component, the `dataEmitter` event is emitted, sending the string `'Data from Child Component!'` to the parent component.

#### 2. In the Parent Component:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-parent",
  template: `<app-child (dataEmitter)="receiveData($event)"></app-child>`,
})
export class ParentComponent {
  receiveData(data: string) {
    // Handle the data received from the child
    console.log(data); // Will print: Data from Child Component!
  }
}
```

- Here, the `dataEmitter` event is listened to in the parent component using `(dataEmitter)`, and when the data is received, the `receiveData()` function is executed.

### Key Points:

- **`@Output()`** is used to pass data from the child component to the parent component.
- **`EventEmitter`** emits the event along with the data.
- The parent component listens to this event using the `(eventName)` syntax.

### Benefits:

- **`Outputs`** and **`Emitting Data`** make it easy to communicate between components, allowing you to send data or notifications from one component to another, which contributes to building interactive and cohesive applications.

In Angular, **decorators** are special tools or functions used to define behavior or provide additional metadata to components, services, and properties. Decorators are a core part of Angular's programming model, allowing developers to define how code should behave with simple additions.

### Basic Concept:

- A **decorator** is simply a function placed above classes, properties, or methods to add **metadata** or additional **functionality**.
- Angular uses this metadata to understand the structure of the decorated component or element and how to interact with it.

### Types of Decorators in Angular:

1. **`@Component`**:

   - Used to define a component in Angular.
   - Contains metadata like the template and styles that define how the component will look and behave.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     @Component({
       selector: "app-root",
       templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
       styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"],
     })
     export class AppComponent {
       title = "My Angular App";
     }
     ```

2. **`@NgModule`**:

   - Used to define a module in Angular, which is a collection of components, directives, and services that belong together.
   - Contains metadata that defines the module's components and services.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     @NgModule({
       declarations: [AppComponent],
       imports: [BrowserModule],
       bootstrap: [AppComponent],
     })
     export class AppModule {}
     ```

3. **`@Injectable`**:

   - Used to define a service that can be injected into other components or services.
   - It tells Angular that this class can be used as an injectable service.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     @Injectable({
       providedIn: "root",
     })
     export class DataService {
       getData() {
         return ["data1", "data2"];
       }
     }
     ```

4. **`@Input`** and **`@Output`**:

   - **`@Input`**: Used to pass data from the parent component to the child component.
   - **`@Output`**: Used to send data from the child component to the parent component.
   - Example:

     ```typescript
     @Component({
       selector: "app-child",
       template: `<p>{{ childData }}</p>`,
     })
     export class ChildComponent {
       @Input() childData: string;
       @Output() dataEmitter = new EventEmitter<string>();

       sendData() {
         this.dataEmitter.emit("Data from Child");
       }
     }
     ```

5. **`@HostListener`** and **`@HostBinding`**:

   - **`@HostListener`**: Used to listen to events from the host, such as listening to click events.
   - **`@HostBinding`**: Used to bind specific properties to the host element.
   - Example:

     ```typescript
     @Directive({
       selector: "[appHighlight]",
     })
     export class HighlightDirective {
       @HostBinding("style.backgroundColor") bgColor: string;

       @HostListener("mouseenter") onMouseEnter() {
         this.bgColor = "yellow";
       }

       @HostListener("mouseleave") onMouseLeave() {
         this.bgColor = "white";
       }
     }
     ```

### Importance of Decorators:

- **Add metadata**: Decorators allow the addition of information about components, modules, and services, making it easier for Angular to understand the structure of the application and how to interact with its elements.
- **Customization and extensibility**: Decorators can be used to customize the behavior of components and classes in flexible and extendable ways.
- **Organized code**: Decorators provide a clear and organized structure that makes the code more maintainable and understandable.

In summary, **decorators** are an essential part of Angular and are used to define the behaviors of application components and modules in flexible and customizable ways.
