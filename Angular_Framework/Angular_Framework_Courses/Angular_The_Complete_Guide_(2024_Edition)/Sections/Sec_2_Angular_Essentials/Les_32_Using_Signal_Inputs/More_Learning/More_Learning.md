## More Learning:

In Angular, the concept of **Signal Inputs** refers to a new mechanism for updating data (Inputs) within components more efficiently. It is part of the new features introduced in Angular to improve performance and state management of components.

### The main idea behind Signal Inputs:

- Developers can use **Signals** to pass data between components in a reactive and efficient way. The key benefit here is the ability to **automatically trigger component reactivity** when the value changes, without needing techniques like traditional `@Input()` or manual change detection.

### Advantages:

1. **Improved performance**: Thanks to the internal state management of Signals, it can enhance the performance of updates when data changes.
2. **Increased reactivity**: It allows handling data changes automatically and in an organized manner.
3. **Alternative to @Input()**: Signals serve as an alternative to passing data between components using the `@Input()` decorator.

This concept is still being developed and improved within Angular, and it may require installing additional packages or using specific versions of Angular.
