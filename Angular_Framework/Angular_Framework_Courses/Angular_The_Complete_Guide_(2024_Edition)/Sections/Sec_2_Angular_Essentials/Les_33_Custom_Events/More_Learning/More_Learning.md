In Angular, the concept of **Custom Events** refers to creating custom events that developers can trigger to exchange data or execute specific actions between components.

### Custom Events in Angular:

- Essentially, **Custom Events** allow Angular components to communicate with each other by emitting and receiving events. These events can be customized and created using native JavaScript objects like `EventEmitter`.
- The event is created in the parent component (or any component), and then it is listened to and responded to in other components.

### How to Create Custom Events:

1. **Using `@Output()` and `EventEmitter`**:
   - The `@Output()` decorator is used along with `EventEmitter` to define a custom event in a component.
   - `EventEmitter` is an object that allows you to trigger events when needed.
2. **Listening to Custom Events**:
   - Custom events are listened to in the template using the syntax `(eventName)`.
   - When the event is listened to, a specific function can be executed upon the event being triggered.

### Simple Example:

#### 1. In the child component:

```typescript
import { Component, Output, EventEmitter } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: `<button (click)="sendData()">Send Data</button>`,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Output() customEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();

  sendData() {
    this.customEvent.emit("Hello from Child Component!");
  }
}
```

#### 2. In the parent component:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "app-parent",
  template: `<app-child (customEvent)="handleCustomEvent($event)"></app-child>`,
})
export class ParentComponent {
  handleCustomEvent(data: string) {
    console.log(data); // Will log: Hello from Child Component!
  }
}
```

### Benefits:

- **Custom Events** simplify component communication, allowing data to be shared or specific actions to be triggered interactively.
- This pattern is particularly useful in large applications where multiple components need to interact with each other.

### Note:

- `@Output()` and `EventEmitter` are commonly used when you need to pass data from the child component to the parent component, whereas `@Input()` is used to pass data in the opposite direction (from parent to child).
