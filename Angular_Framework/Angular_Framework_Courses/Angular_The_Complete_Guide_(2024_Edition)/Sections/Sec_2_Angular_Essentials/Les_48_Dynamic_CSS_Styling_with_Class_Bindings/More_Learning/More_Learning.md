## More Learning:

In **Angular**, the concept of **Dynamic CSS Styling** refers to the ability to **change styles (CSS)** dynamically based on certain conditions or data in the application. This allows you to update the appearance of elements on a web page depending on the values or conditions that change in the code.

There are several ways to implement **Dynamic CSS Styling** in Angular, such as using **attribute binding** or directives like `ngClass` and `ngStyle`.

### 1. **Attribute Binding**

You can use **binding** to HTML attributes like `style` to set CSS styles directly. This method allows you to bind style values to properties of objects in the component.

#### Example:

```html
<div [style.color]="isActive ? 'green' : 'red'">
  This text will be green if isActive is true, and red if false.
</div>
```

In this example:

- The color is set based on the value of the **`isActive`** variable. If it's **`true`**, the color becomes green, and if it's **`false`**, the color becomes red.

### 2. **`ngClass` for Applying CSS Classes**

You can use **`ngClass`** to apply or remove CSS classes conditionally. This method is more flexible because it allows you to activate or deactivate an entire set of styles at once.

#### Example:

```html
<div [ngClass]="{ 'active-class': isActive, 'inactive-class': !isActive }">
  This div will have dynamic CSS classes.
</div>
```

In this example:

- **`ngClass`** adds the `active-class` if **`isActive`** is `true`, and adds the `inactive-class` if **`isActive`** is `false`.

#### CSS:

```css
.active-class {
  color: green;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.inactive-class {
  color: red;
  font-weight: normal;
}
```

### 3. **`ngStyle` for Direct CSS Styling**

If you want to apply dynamic CSS styles without using classes, you can use **`ngStyle`**. This method allows you to change the actual values of the styles.

#### Example:

```html
<div
  [ngStyle]="{ 'font-size.px': fontSize, 'background-color': backgroundColor }"
>
  This div has dynamic inline styles.
</div>
```

In this example:

- The font size and background color are tied to the variables **`fontSize`** and **`backgroundColor`** in the component.

### 4. **Combining `ngClass` and `ngStyle`**

You can also combine **`ngClass`** and **`ngStyle`** to apply styles more flexibly based on conditions.

#### Example:

```html
<div
  [ngClass]="{ 'highlight': isHighlighted }"
  [ngStyle]="{ 'border': borderStyle }"
>
  This div has both dynamic classes and styles.
</div>
```

- Here, **`ngClass`** is used to apply a CSS class based on a condition, while **`ngStyle`** is used to apply a specific style (such as borders) based on a variable's value.

### 5. **Changing Styles Based on Events**

You can also change styles based on events like **`click`** or **`hover`**. For example, you can use a `click` event to change the value of a variable that controls the styles.

#### Example:

```html
<button (click)="toggleActive()">Toggle Active</button>

<div [ngClass]="{ 'active': isActive }">
  This div's style changes when the button is clicked.
</div>
```

#### Component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  isActive = false;

  toggleActive() {
    this.isActive = !this.isActive;
  }
}
```

In this example, the style changes based on a button click to activate or deactivate the `active` class.

### Summary:

**Dynamic CSS Styling** in Angular refers to the ability to change element styles based on certain conditions or events. You can use tools like **`ngClass`** and **`ngStyle`** to bind styles to dynamic variables in the application, allowing the styles to update automatically when the data changes.
