## More Learning:

In the context of Angular, a **getter** is part of the **property accessors** concept in JavaScript/TypeScript. It is used to retrieve the value of a certain property from objects, with the ability to execute custom logic when accessing this property.

In Angular, a getter can be used in a **Component** to retrieve a value that is used in the template. Here's an example:

```typescript
export class MyComponent {
  private _name: string = "Angular";

  // Define the getter
  get name(): string {
    return this._name.toUpperCase(); // We can apply custom logic here, like converting text to uppercase.
  }
}
```

In the component's HTML (template):

```html
<p>{{ name }}</p>
<!-- This will display 'ANGULAR' -->
```

### What makes a getter special?

- It allows you to apply custom logic when accessing a certain value.
- It helps protect data by hiding the original (private) field.
- It makes the code more maintainable by avoiding complex calculations inside the template.

### Usage in Angular:

- A getter is often used to access values that need processing before being displayed.
- It keeps the template simple, avoiding calculations or logic directly in the HTML files.
