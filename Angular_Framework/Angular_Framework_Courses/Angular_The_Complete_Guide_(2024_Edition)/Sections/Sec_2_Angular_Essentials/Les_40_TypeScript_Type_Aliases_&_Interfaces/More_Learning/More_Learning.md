## More Learning:

In **TypeScript**, both **Type Aliases** and **Interfaces** provide ways to define custom types, but there are important differences between them in terms of flexibility, usage, and available features. Let’s break down each concept in detail.

## **Type Aliases**

### What is a Type Alias?

A **Type Alias** is a way to define a new name for an existing type or a custom complex type, such as objects, lists, or union types. **Type Aliases** simplify code when a complex type is used repeatedly.

### How to Define a Type Alias?

You define a **Type Alias** using the `type` keyword followed by the name of the new type.

#### Example:

```typescript
type UserID = string | number;

let id1: UserID = 101; // number type
let id2: UserID = "AB123"; // string type
```

In this example, `UserID` is an alias that can be either a `number` or a `string`.

### Using Type Aliases with Objects

You can define a **Type Alias** for a complex object with multiple properties.

#### Example:

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isActive: boolean;
};

let user: User = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isActive: true,
};
```

### Union and Intersection Types with Type Aliases

**Type Aliases** also support union and intersection types.

#### Union Types:

```typescript
type Result = "success" | "failure";

let response: Result = "success"; // can be either 'success' or 'failure'
```

#### Intersection Types:

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string;
};

type Employee = Person & {
  employeeId: number;
};

let employee: Employee = {
  name: "Alice",
  employeeId: 123,
};
```

### When to Use **Type Aliases**?

- **Complex types**: When you need to define Union or Intersection Types.
- **Complex objects**: To simplify the reuse of frequently used complex types.
- **Flexibility**: When you want more control and flexibility in defining types.

## **Interfaces**

### What is an Interface?

An **Interface** is a special type used to define the structure of an object. It is useful for specifying properties and types for objects, and it supports inheritance.

### How to Define an Interface?

You define an **Interface** using the `interface` keyword.

#### Example:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isActive: boolean;
}

let user: User = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 25,
  isActive: true,
};
```

### Extending Interfaces

**Interfaces** can inherit from other interfaces, allowing you to create more complex structures through extension.

#### Example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  employeeId: number;
}

let employee: Employee = {
  name: "Charlie",
  employeeId: 456,
};
```

### **Interfaces** vs **Type Aliases**

1. **Extension**:
   - **Interfaces** can inherit from other interfaces or merge multiple interfaces using the `extends` keyword.
   - **Type Aliases** can combine types using **Intersection Types** (`&`), but they don't support full inheritance like interfaces.

#### Interface Extension Example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  employeeId: number;
}
```

#### Type Alias Intersection Example:

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string;
};

type Employee = Person & {
  employeeId: number;
};
```

2. **Flexibility**:

   - **Type Aliases** are more flexible since they support complex types like **Union Types** and **Intersection Types**.
   - **Interfaces** are mainly used for defining object structures but don’t directly support union types.

3. **Reopening**:
   - **Interfaces** can be reopened and extended anywhere in the code.
   - **Type Aliases** cannot be modified or reopened after they are defined.

#### Example of Reopening an Interface:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

let user: User = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }; // works without issues
```

### When to Use **Interfaces**?

- **Objects**: When you need to define a data structure for objects with specific properties.
- **Inheritance**: When you need to extend interfaces or create a hierarchy of types.

---

### Conclusion:

- **Type Aliases**: Are used to simplify complex types, such as Union Types or Intersection Types, and are more flexible.
- **Interfaces**: Are used to define object structures, supporting inheritance and reopening for adding properties.

The choice between **Type Aliases** and **Interfaces** depends on the project’s requirements. If you need a flexible and complex type structure, use **Type Aliases**. If you need an extendable data structure for objects, use **Interfaces**.
