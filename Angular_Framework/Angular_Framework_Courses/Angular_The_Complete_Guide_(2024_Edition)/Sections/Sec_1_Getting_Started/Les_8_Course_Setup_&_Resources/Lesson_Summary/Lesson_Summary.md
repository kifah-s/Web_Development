## Lesson Summary:

### Course Setup & Resources

This is a huge course with many demo projects, examples & concepts. Here are some resources that should help you with taking this course:

#### Academind Learning Community

As a student of this course you also get access to the Academind Learning Community - a free Discord channel you can join to find like-minded students. You can search for learning partners, ask questions, share projects and, in general, boost your learning experience by diving into this community. Of course, joining is not mandatory and you can leave at any time.

#### IDE / Code Editor

For following along with this course, you can use VS Code - a free, extensible IDE that works on all operating systems.

A popular alternative are the IDEs offered by Jetbrains. They offer a variety of IDEs for different programming languages and projects. For web development, Webstorm is a popular choice.

As a student of this course, you can get one Jetbrains IDE for free for six months!

All you need to do, is select it and enter the following coupon code on the checkout page: ACADEMIND_JETBRAINS.

You find detailed instructions regarding the coupon code usage on this page.

Please note: Using Jetbrains IDEs is optional (you could use VS Code). If you do go for the Jetbrains deal, you'll need to enter your email address during the checkout process.

#### Course Code Snapshots

When coding along, it's possible that you run into errors from time to time. In order to help you with those, I prepared a course code repository where you can find multiple code snapshots for every course section. You can use those snapshots to compare your code to mine and hopefully resolve any issues you might encounter.

#### Course Slides

Whilst the majority of the videos in this course shows you hands-on demos & examples, I also do use some slides in some of the videos. You can download those from the course code repository.

#### TypeScript Introduction

This course also uses TypeScript as a programming language since Angular uses TypeScript. The good news is: You don't need to know TypeScript to take this course! You'll learn it along the way.

But if you ever feel like you don't fully understand a certain TypeScript concept or you're having a hard time following along with the TypeScript code shown in the videos, you can dive into the dedicated "TypeScript Introduction" course section I prepared for you.
