## More Learning:

In Angular, **component communication** can be done in several ways, and one of these ways is using **outputs** with **custom events**. This approach helps components communicate with each other when there is a need to transfer data or trigger events between two components.

### What is the concept of outputs?

Outputs are a way to pass data or events from a child component to a parent component (or any component containing it). The `@Output` property is used in the child component to trigger an event that the parent can listen to. When something happens in the child component, it can emit this event and pass data to the parent component.

### How does communication work using outputs?

#### 1. Create a custom event in the child component:

In the child component, we create an event using `@Output` and use `EventEmitter` to emit events.

#### 2. Listen to the event in the parent component:

In the parent component, we listen to the event sent by the child component and handle the data or perform a certain action when the event occurs.

### Steps:

#### 1. In the child component:

```typescript
import { Component, Output, EventEmitter } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: ` <button (click)="sendMessage()">Send Message</button> `,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Output() messageEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();

  sendMessage() {
    this.messageEvent.emit("Hello from Child!");
  }
}
```

- In this example, we use `@Output` to define an event called `messageEvent`.
- We use `EventEmitter` to send data when the `sendMessage` function is called.
- When the button is clicked, a message is sent to the parent component using `.emit()`.

#### 2. In the parent component:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-parent",
  template: `
    <app-child (messageEvent)="receiveMessage($event)"></app-child>
    <p>Message: {{ message }}</p>
  `,
})
export class ParentComponent {
  message: string = "";

  receiveMessage(message: string) {
    this.message = message;
  }
}
```

- In this component, we listen to the `messageEvent` from the child component using parentheses `(messageEvent)` in the HTML template.
- When the event is triggered from the child, the `receiveMessage` function in the parent component is called, receiving the message sent from the child and storing it in the `message` variable.

### Process Explanation:

1. The **child component** emits a custom event (`messageEvent`) using `@Output` and `EventEmitter`.
2. When an event occurs (in this case, clicking the button), data (in this case, "Hello from Child!") is sent to the parent component.
3. The **parent component** listens to the event and performs a certain action (in this case, updating the `message` variable).

### When to use outputs?

- When you need to send data or signals from a child component to a higher component in the component hierarchy.
- When dealing with complex forms or user interfaces that contain multiple components needing interaction between them.

### Benefits:

- Good separation of concerns, where each component maintains its own responsibilities without directly depending on other components.
- Easier to reuse components in different places while allowing event customization.

**What are Outputs in Angular?**

Outputs in Angular are a mechanism that allows child components to send data or events to their parent components. Imagine you have a search component (child component) and a results component (parent component). When a user enters a search term in the search component, that term needs to be sent to the results component to perform the search. This is where outputs come into play.

**How do Outputs work?**

1. **Defining the Output:** In the child component, you define an output using the `@Output()` decorator and link it to an EventEmitter.
2. **Emitting the Event:** When a specific event occurs in the child component (like clicking a search button), the event associated with the output is emitted by calling the `emit()` method on the EventEmitter.
3. **Listening to the Event:** In the parent component, you listen to the event using the `(event)` binding, where `event` is the name of the output. A function is executed when this event occurs, receiving the data sent from the child component.

**Practical Example:**

**Child Component (search-component.ts):**

```typescript
import { Component, Output, EventEmitter } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-search",
  templateUrl: "./search.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./search.component.css"],
})
export class SearchComponent {
  @Output() searchTerm = new EventEmitter<string>();

  onSearch() {
    this.searchTerm.emit(this.searchValue); // searchValue is a variable containing the search term
  }
}
```

**Parent Component (parent-component.ts):**

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-parent",
  templateUrl: "./parent.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./parent.component.css"],
})
export class ParentComponent {
  onSearchTerm(searchTerm: string) {
    // Handle the search term received from the child component
    console.log("Search term:", searchTerm);
  }
}
```

**Parent Component Template (parent.component.html):**

```html
<app-search (searchTerm)="onSearchTerm($event)"></app-search>
<div>Search results: {{ searchResults }}</div>
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

- In the search component, an output named `searchTerm` of type `EventEmitter<string>` is defined.
- When the search button is clicked, the `searchTerm` event is emitted with the search value.
- In the parent component, the `searchTerm` event is listened to using `(searchTerm)="onSearchTerm($event)"` and the `onSearchTerm` function is executed when the event occurs.

**Why Use Outputs?**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Allows for clear separation of component logic and responsibilities.
- **Reusability:** Child components can be reused in different places with different behaviors based on outputs.
- **Interaction:** Enables components to interact with each other in a structured way.

**Important Notes:**

- Outputs are unidirectional, from child to parent.
- Any type of data can be sent through outputs, not just strings.
- A child component can emit multiple outputs.

**Summary:**

Outputs are a powerful tool in Angular that enables seamless communication between components. By understanding how they work and using them correctly, you can build more complex and flexible Angular applications.

**Additional Notes:**

- Outputs can be used with inputs to achieve two-way binding between components.
- Services can be used to pass data between components that are not directly related to each other.
