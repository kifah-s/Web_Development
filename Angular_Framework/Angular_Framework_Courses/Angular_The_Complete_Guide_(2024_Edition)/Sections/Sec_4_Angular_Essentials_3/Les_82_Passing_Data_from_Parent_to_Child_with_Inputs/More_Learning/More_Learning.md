In Angular, **passing data from a parent component to a child component** is typically done using **inputs**. Inputs allow components to receive data from parent components, enabling better interaction between them.

### What is the concept of Inputs?

**Inputs** are properties in the child component that are defined using the `@Input` decorator. These properties allow the child component to receive data from the parent component or any other component that includes it in its template.

### How is data passed using Inputs?

#### 1. Create an `@Input` property in the child component:

In the child component, an `@Input` property is defined to receive data from the parent component.

#### 2. Pass the data from the parent component to the child component:

In the parent component, data is passed to the child component's input property using property binding in the template.

### Steps:

#### 1. In the child component:

```typescript
import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: ` <p>{{ childMessage }}</p> `,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() childMessage: string = "";
}
```

- Here, we define the `childMessage` property using the `@Input` decorator, making it ready to receive data from another component (the parent component in this case).
- The value of `childMessage` will be displayed in the template using interpolation.

#### 2. In the parent component:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-parent",
  template: ` <app-child [childMessage]="parentMessage"></app-child> `,
})
export class ParentComponent {
  parentMessage: string = "Hello from Parent!";
}
```

- In the parent component, the value of `parentMessage` is passed to the `childMessage` property of the child component using square brackets `[childMessage]`.
- This value becomes available in the child component and is displayed in its UI.

### Process Explanation:

1. In the **child component**, an `@Input` property is defined to receive external data.
2. In the **parent component**, data is passed to this property using property binding in the template.
3. When the parent component passes the data, it is displayed or used inside the child component.

### Another Example:

#### 1. In the child component:

```typescript
import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: ` <h3>{{ name }}</h3> `,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() name: string = "";
}
```

#### 2. In the parent component:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-parent",
  template: ` <app-child [name]="'Angular Developer'"></app-child> `,
})
export class ParentComponent {}
```

- Here, the parent component passes the string `'Angular Developer'` to the `name` property of the child component.

### When to use Inputs?

- When you need to pass static or dynamic data from a parent component to a child component.
- In applications that need to display complex data divided across multiple components, you can pass data from higher-level components to lower-level ones.

### Benefits:

- Inputs make components more flexible and reusable, allowing the same child component to be used in different places while customizing the data it displays.
- Good separation of concerns, allowing each component to handle a specific part of the application without directly depending on other components.

**What are Inputs in Angular?**

Inputs in Angular are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. Imagine you have a product card component (child component) that displays information about a product, and the parent component holds a list of products. You can use inputs to enable the parent component to pass product information to the product card component for display.

**How do Inputs work?**

1. **Defining the Input:** In the child component, you define an input using the `@Input()` decorator. This input indicates the data that the child component expects to receive from the parent.
2. **Passing Data:** In the parent component's template, you pass a value to the input using a custom attribute.
3. **Using the Data:** Inside the child component, you use the input value to display data or perform other operations.

**Practical Example:**

**Child Component (product-card.component.ts):**

```typescript
import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-product-card",
  templateUrl: "./product-card.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./product-card.component.css"],
})
export class ProductCardComponent {
  @Input() product: any;
}
```

**Parent Component (products-list.component.ts):**

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-products-list",
  templateUrl: "./products-list.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./products-list.component.css"],
})
export class ProductsListComponent {
  products = [
    { id: 1, name: "Product 1", price: 100 },
    { id: 2, name: "Product 2", price: 200 },
  ];
}
```

**Parent Component Template (products-list.component.html):**

```html
<div *ngFor="let product of products">
  <app-product-card [product]="product"></app-product-card>
</div>
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

- In the product card component, an input named `product` is defined.
- In the products list component, each product is passed to the product card component using `[product]="product"`.
- Inside the product card component, `product` is used to display product details.

**Why Use Inputs?**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Allows for clear separation of component logic and responsibilities.
- **Reusability:** Child components can be reused in different places with different data.
- **Organization:** Improves code readability and makes applications more maintainable.

**Important Notes:**

- Inputs are unidirectional, from parent to child.
- Any type of data can be passed through inputs, not just strings.
- A child component can define multiple inputs.

**Summary:**

Inputs are a fundamental tool in Angular for passing data from parent components to child components. By understanding how they work and using them correctly, you can build more organized and flexible Angular applications.

**Additional Notes:**

- Inputs can be used with outputs to achieve two-way binding between components.
- Services can be used to pass data between components that are not directly related to each other.
