## More Learning:

In the **Angular** framework, **`FormsModule`** and **`ngSubmit`** provide powerful tools for creating and interacting with forms.

### 1. **`FormsModule`**:

`FormsModule` is one of the core modules in Angular that helps you manage forms. With it, you can create interactive forms that easily bind form elements to component data.

#### Key features of `FormsModule`:

- **Two-way data binding:** You can use the `[(ngModel)]` directive to bind form fields to properties in the component.
- **Input validation:** It provides input validation features like required fields or email format validation.
- **Form state management:** It tracks the state of fields (e.g., whether they are empty or if the values are valid).

#### How to use `FormsModule`:

To use `FormsModule`, you need to import it into the main module of your project:

```typescript
import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";

@NgModule({
  imports: [FormsModule], // Add FormsModule here
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### 2. **`ngSubmit`**:

`ngSubmit` is a directive used to handle form submission events. When using `ngSubmit`, you can trigger a specific function when the form is submitted, making it easy to handle user inputs and validate the data before sending it.

#### How to use `ngSubmit`:

- `ngSubmit` is used on the `<form>` element and is bound to the function you want to invoke when the form is submitted.

### Complete Example:

#### Module Setup (`app.module.ts`):

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms"; // Import FormsModule

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule], // Add FormsModule here
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Component Setup (`app.component.ts`):

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"],
})
export class AppComponent {
  username: string = "";
  email: string = "";

  // Function called when the form is submitted
  onSubmit() {
    console.log("Form Submitted!");
    console.log("Username:", this.username);
    console.log("Email:", this.email);
  }
}
```

#### User Interface (`app.component.html`):

```html
<h2>Register</h2>
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    id="username"
    [(ngModel)]="username"
    name="username"
    required
  />
  <br /><br />

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" [(ngModel)]="email" name="email" required />
  <br /><br />

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<p>Entered Username: {{ username }}</p>
<p>Entered Email: {{ email }}</p>
```

### Example Explanation:

- **`FormsModule`:** Allows you to use `[(ngModel)]` to bind the fields with component variables.
- **`ngSubmit`:** When the form is submitted (by clicking the "Submit" button), the `onSubmit()` function is triggered to handle or display the entered data.

### How it works:

1. The user fills in the "Username" and "Email" fields.
2. When they click "Submit", the `onSubmit()` function is invoked, processing or logging the input data.

FormsModule is a fundamental module in Angular that provides a set of tools and services to create and manage interactive forms in your Angular applications. Essentially, it's responsible for handling form inputs such as text fields, checkboxes, and select elements, and updating the corresponding data in your application model.

**What is its primary function?**

- **Binding form elements to data:** It allows you to create form elements (like inputs, selects, etc.) and bind them to properties in your Angular component. When a user enters a value into a form element, the associated property is automatically updated.
- **Validating data:** It provides a collection of functions and directives to validate the data entered into the form, such as ensuring that a field is required, an email has the correct format, or a password is strong enough.
- **Interacting with the user:** You can use FormsModule to display error messages to the user if they enter invalid data, or to provide additional feedback on how to fill out the form.

**When do we use FormsModule?**

FormsModule is primarily used when creating forms in Angular applications. Whether you're building a simple login form, a user registration form, or a complex data collection form, FormsModule is the essential tool you'll use.

**A simple example:**

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";

@Component({
  selector: "app-my-form",
  templateUrl: "./my-form.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./my-form.component.css"],
  imports: [FormsModule], // Here we add FormsModule to the component
})
export class MyFormComponent {
  name = "";

  onSubmit() {
    console.log("Your name is:", this.name);
  }
}
```

```html
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name" placeholder="Enter your name" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In this simple example, we've created a form with a single text field for the user's name. When the user enters their name, the `name` property in the component is updated, and when the "Submit" button is clicked, the name is displayed in the console.

**In conclusion:**

FormsModule is a powerful and essential tool in Angular for creating interactive forms. It provides you with the foundation needed to bind form elements to data, validate data, and interact with the user. By understanding how to use FormsModule, you can build more complex and effective forms in your Angular applications.
